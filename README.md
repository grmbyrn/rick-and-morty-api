# Rick and Morty Characters App
This is a React app that displays characters from the Rick and Morty TV show. It uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch character data and displays the results using Tailwind CSS for styling. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Pages
### Home
The first page displays a list of characters with their name, status, and origin. The list loads more characters as the user scrolls down. The app uses the useEffect hook to fetch data from the API and the useState hook to keep track of the current page and loading state. It also uses the IntersectionObserver API to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page and load more data. The Navbar component is used to display a header with the app's name.

### Character Details
Clicking on a character from the home page will take the user to the character details page. This view displays the character's name, status, origin, gender, and location. The app uses the useParams hook from react-router-dom to get the character's id from the URL and fetches the character data using the useEffect and useState hooks. The Navbar component is used to display a header with a link to go back to the home view.

## Components
### Navbar
The Navbar component is used in both views to display a header with the app's name and a link to go back to the home page.

### Cards
The Cards component is used in the home page to display a list of characters. It takes an array of character objects as a prop and maps over them to create a div for each character. Each div displays the character's name, status, origin, and an image. The image is wrapped in a Link component from react-router-dom to navigate to the character details page when clicked. The Cards component uses the uuidv4 library to generate a unique key prop for each character div.

### CardDetails
The CardDetails component is used in the character details view to display the character's details. It uses the useParams hook from react-router-dom to get the character's id from the URL and fetches the character data using the useEffect and useState hooks. It displays the character's name, status, origin, gender, and location.
